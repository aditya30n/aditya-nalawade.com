Different projects played important role in my learning curve. I started to apply my knowledge to the projects one after another and learned new things as day passed.

<br />One important thing I learned through this journey is that you must be patient and calm to write the code and should not hurry. One small bug can lead to a big issue in near future.  
<br />As it is said practice makes man perfect. You need to work on different assignments and actually write the code to come close to perfect. And thats what I did and now I have enough confidence to handle any kind of challenge in software industry.

I am not a perfect guy. I learn everyday from my experience whether it is personal life or professional life.
I like being with my friends, have fun with them and enjoy the moment. I like to try food from around the world. I love to go to new restaurants and try something new. I like to visit new places and spend some time peacefully.

<p class="hideme about-me-text">
Few years ago I fell in love with programming. From that day onwards I am playing with it. All bugs automatically gets removed from your life when you follow your dream which I did by pursuing my Masters. Sometimes I feel like I need to this, I need to work on that. There are so many things still left to be done. But when I think about it and take a step back I remember how amazing life truly is & that maybe, just maybe, I like being imperfect.
